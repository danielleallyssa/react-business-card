          I'm a front-end developer and designer with 7 years in e-commerce and
          30+ websites created. I specialize in tailored solutions and
          problem-solving, and I'm eager to grow in the tech industry!

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m in Connecticut, but my roots are in Philly, where my love for arts
          and design began. After work, I enjoy reading, watching documentaries,
          illustrating, and creating web animations with Three.js and shaders.
